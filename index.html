      <p>Hi! I am Xiaoying Liu. You can call me Teresa. </br>
        Since I graduated from college last year, I have been looking for a path to struggle in San Francisco and I know what I need to do is to master language skill and professional skill. I used to work in ecommerce trading field to see how does an ecommercial business run. I also used to work in a restuarant to learn how to communicate with others. Now I am on my way to explore and master skills that required to become a web front-end developer or back-end developer.
      </p>
      <p>
         I also enjoy visual digital design and like to create something new. In this portfolio, I will represent what I've learned and accomplished by Photoshop.Aiming to let people know how charming visual design can be, I am glad to bring out creative and interesting work to the public.
